# Job definitions should look like this:
#
#example_job:
#  cron: "0 0 * * *"
#  # you can use rufus-scheduler "every" syntax in place of cron if you prefer
#  # every: 1h
#  # By default the job name (hash key) will be taken as worker class name.
#  # If you want to have a different job name and class name, provide the 'class' option
#  class: "QueueDocuments"
#  queue: high
#  args:
#  description: "This job queues all content for indexing in solr"
